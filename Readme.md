# Lighting Use MMWAVES to support Readers 

A smart lighting solution that uses a millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar sensor to automatically detect human presence at a reading desk and control the light accordingly â€“ enhancing user experience and reducing energy consumption.

## Overview

This system utilizes a **mmWave radar sensor** to detect subtle human motion or presence. When a user is detected near the reading area (e.g., sitting at a desk), the lamp **automatically turns on**. If no presence is detected for a predefined timeout period, the lamp **turns off** to save power.
